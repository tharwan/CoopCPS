# Dynamics of complex systems built as coupled physical, communication and decision layers #

This set of python scripts was used to create the results for the publication which can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04235).

The scripts need at least a version of NumPy, NetworkX, Cython to work. For plotting the results matplotlib and seaborn are also needed.
